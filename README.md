## Install

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Problem & Solution 1

- Race condition (stock update)
- `synchronized`
  - `@Transactional` can also cause race condition. So must remove before using it.

## Problem & Solution 2

- Race condition
  - The `synchronized` keyword is guaranteed only within one process. 
  - If there is only one server, this is fine, but if there are multiple servers, access to the data occurs from multiple places.
- Pessimistic Lock
  - If collisions occur frequently, better performance than Optimistic Lock.
  - Guarantee data consistency.
  - Performance may decrease.
